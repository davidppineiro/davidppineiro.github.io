At NTNU, I was a teaching assistant for the master's level courses <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TEP4135#tab=omEmnet">TEP4135 - Fluid Mechanics 2</a> in the fall of 2018 and <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TKP4140#tab=omEmnet">TKP4140 - Process Control</a> during the falls of 2019, 2020, and 2021. 

Besides teaching, I supervised master's theses on a variety of topics, including energy system modeling, optimization, and control.
