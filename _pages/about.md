I am a research scientist at Gridmatic interested in questions of how
optimization and machine learning can transform energy markets, make the grid
more predictable, and accelerate the adoption of renewable energy.

I hold a BS in Energy Engineering from the University of Vigo and an MS in
Sustainable Energy from NTNU, where I am pursuing my PhD in Control Systems and
Optimization under Professor <a href="https://folk.ntnu.no/skoge/">Sigurd
Skogestad</a>. I have done research stays at MIT with Professor <a
href="https://web.mit.edu/braatzgroup/index.html">Richard Braatz</a> and at
Stanford with Professor <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/">Stephen
Boyd</a>. I am also a recipient of a "la Caixa" Foundation postgraduate
fellowship.
